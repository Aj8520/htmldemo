# Web Page Documentation

## Overview

This project provides a simple framework for creating a web application with navigation functionality. The primary feature of this project is the `jewelloNavigation.js` file, which contains JavaScript functions that facilitate navigation within the application. Each function sends a message to a JavaScript channel named `Toaster`, which triggers navigation to different sections of the application.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to help users, especially those unfamiliar with HTML and CSS, to design a basic web page that utilizes the navigation functions defined in `jewelloNavigation.js`. This documentation will guide you through the process of creating a web page, styling it with CSS, and integrating the JavaScript navigation functionality.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. **Open the Project**: Use a code editor to open the project folder.
3. **Create an HTML File**: Create a new HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) in the project directory.
4. **Link the JavaScript File**: Include the `jewelloNavigation.js` file in your HTML file to enable navigation functionality.

## Usage

To use the navigation functions, you will need to call them from your HTML elements (e.g., buttons or links). Each function corresponds to a specific navigation action. For example, to navigate to the scheme section, you would call `navigateToScheme()`.
